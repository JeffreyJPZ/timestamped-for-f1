# [Timestamped for F1](https://timestampedforf1.jeffreyjpz.com)
A play-by-play/events archive for Formula 1. View overtakes, qualifying laps, pit stops, incidents, and more as they happened.

This project uses a fork of [OpenF1](https://github.com/br-g/openf1) with custom event processing logic, as well as [MultiViewer](https://multiviewer.app/) for circuit data.

## Roadmap
- Format event tags
- Implement event filtering by tags (driver, pit stop time, incident verdict, etc.)
- Implement event querying over all seasons
- Attach circuit view to events with location data
- Improve UI (add icons for event types, team colours for drivers)

## Developing locally
TODO
